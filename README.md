## 📍 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of state-of-the-art AI tools to design novel miniprotein binders from scratch, targeting a therapeutically relevant protein. The pipeline integrates RFdiffusion for backbone generation, ProteinMPNN for sequence design, and Rosetta/AlphaFold2 for structure refinement and ranking.

This is a step-by-step, fully documented learning project aimed at:
- Gaining practical experience with generative protein design workflows
- Understanding binder-target interactions
- Building a public portfolio that shows ML + structural bioinformatics integration

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Select a therapeutic target with available 3D structure (e.g., IL-6, HER2, PD-1)
- Generate candidate binder backbones with RFdiffusion
- Design sequences with ProteinMPNN
- Predict/refine final binder structures using AlphaFold2 or RosettaRelax
- Rank and filter binders based on scores (pLDDT, Rosetta energy, interface quality)
- Visualize binding interfaces and structural quality with PyMOL
- Maintain a clean, reproducible, and documented GitHub project
